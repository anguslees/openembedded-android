# The board expects the bootloader to be at offset 0x400 of SD-CARd in the bottom slot.
# The generated u-boot.bin is zero-padded from offset 0x000 to offset 0x400.
#
# You may flash it using a command like :
#	# dd if=/u-boot.bin of=/dev/sdX
#
# Alternatively, if you want to keep your partition table intact, you can use
# something like :
#	# dd if=/u-boot.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=512 seek=2 skip=2
#
# Note that both of these commands will destroy any filesystem present on the
# sectors u-boot will be written. Please Consider creating your partition
# table accordingly.
