TI WL1251 firmware is not redistributable. Please download from your device.
You need the following files, which should reside in /etc/firmware or /lib/firmware.
 * wl1251-fw.bin   (firmware)
 * wl1251-nvs.bin  (calibration data)
Note that the calibration data is device specific, so you are not supposed
to just grab it from any location but your device.
