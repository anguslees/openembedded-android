# Marcin,

#     maintained and the source code is not changed. I do not
#     see a problem with your mods to enable fileop for Linux-arm,
#     as these mods have been returned to the Iozone folks,
#     and they have been accepted for inclusion in the next
#     release :-)
#
# Thank you for your contribution,
# Don Capps
