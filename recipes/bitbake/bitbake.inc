DESCRIPTION = "BitBake is a simple tool for the execution of tasks. It is \
derived from Portage, which is the package management system used by the \
Gentoo Linux distribution. It is most commonly used to build packages, as it \
can easily use its rudimentary inheritence to abstract common operations, such \
as fetching sources, unpacking them, patching them, compiling them, and so on. \
It is the basis of the OpenEmbedded project, which is being used for \
Angstrom and a number of other embedded Linux distributions."
