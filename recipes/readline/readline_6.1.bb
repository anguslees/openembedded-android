DESCRIPTION = "The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit \
command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes  \
additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those   \
lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands."

# Don't bring it in silently because there was a switch from GPLv2
