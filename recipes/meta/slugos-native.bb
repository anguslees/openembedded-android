# If a tool won't build *on thumb libc* add it to the following list.
# Normally such a tool should be built with the ARM instruction set
# even on a thumb system (and this can be set in the tool's .bb file),
# however even this doesn't work for very large programs at present
# (only monotone!)
####### *-*-* TEMPORARY: mwester - remove monotone as it wont' build.
