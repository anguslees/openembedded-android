# The Boost web site provides free peer-reviewed portable
# C++ source libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which
# work well with the C++ Standard Library. The libraries are
# intended to be widely useful, and are in regular use by
# thousands of programmers across a broad spectrum of applications.

# Oh yippee, a new build system, it's sooo cooool I could eat my own
# foot.  inlining=on lets the compiler choose, I think.  At least this
# stuff is documented...
# NOTE: if you leave <debug-symbols>on then in a debug build the build sys
# objcopy will be invoked, and that won't work.  Building debug apparently
# requires hacking gcc-tools.jam
#
# Sometimes I wake up screaming.  Famous figures are gathered in the nightmare,
# Steve Bourne, Larry Wall, the whole of the ANSI C committee.  They're just
# standing there, waiting, but the truely terrifying thing is what they carry
# in their hands.  At first sight each seems to bear the same thing, but it is
# not so for the forms in their grasp are ever so slightly different one from
# the other.  Each is twisted in some grotesque way from the other to make each
# an unspeakable perversion impossible to perceive without the onset of madness.
# True insanity awaits anyone who perceives all of these horrors together.
#
# Quotation marks, there might be an easier way to do this, but I can't find
# it.  The problem is that the user.hpp configuration file must receive a
# pre-processor macro defined as the appropriate string - complete with "'s
# around it.  (<> is a possibility here but the danger to that is that the
# failure case interprets the < and > as shell redirections, creating
# random files in the source tree.)
