# hwclock.sh Set system clock to hardware clock, according to the UTC
#               setting in /etc/default/rcS (see also rcS(5)).
#
# WARNING:      If your hardware clock is not in UTC/GMT, this script
#               must know the local time zone. This information is
#               stored in /etc/localtime. This might be a problem if
#               your /etc/localtime is a symlink to something in
#               /usr/share/zoneinfo AND /usr isn't in the root
#               partition! The workaround is to define TZ either
#               in /etc/default/rcS, or in the proper place below.
