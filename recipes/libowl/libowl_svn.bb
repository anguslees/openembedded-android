# This recipe builds libowl and then stages the header and static lib;
# it intentionally does not stage the shared lib and create a package.
#
# Libowl is currently a 'cut and paste' library; this package makes our
# life a touch easier by not having to patch the source directly into
# applications; instead we add -lowl to the linker cmdline. Also, when
# we eventually make libowl into a normal shared library, this package
# will make that transition rather simple.
