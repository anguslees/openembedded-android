= Introduction = 

Depending on platform you need to download one or more components from the external URL and put in downloads directory.

Most components are 'TSPA' now, which mean OE can download them automagically, if a download fails, you should be able to find the archive you need at:

* C6000 Code Generation Tools v6.1.9 Linux (ti_cgt_c6000_6.1.9_setup_linux_x86.bin)
	https://www-a.ti.com/downloads/sds_support/TICodegenerationTools/download.htm
* Generic download URI
	http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_registered_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/

= Version selection =

Tool versions are clustered per codec-engine release, since that combination gets the most testing. Like all other preferred-version files they stored in conf/distro/include:

angstrom-codec-engine-2.25-preferred-versions.inc
angstrom-codec-engine-2.25.01-preferred-versions.inc

You can select between them by putting the following in local.conf:

CE_VERSION = "2.25.01"

You will get a parsing failure if a non-existing version is selected.

= Recipe setup =

Since most of the recipes in this directory deal with a DSP (e.g OMAP3) or accelerators (e.g DM3xx) and have strict per platform version dependencies they are all machine specific. For things like codec-engine, kernel drivers and userspace samples this makes sense, since they are tied to a specific device or platform. For things like codegen and xdc-tools this is weird, but it's the least bad option currently.

The complete unpacked trees are staged to staging/machine/usr/share/ti/${PN}(-tree) and all the _INSTALL_DIR vars will point to that. To make this work there is a ti-staging.inc which contains:

PACKAGE_ARCH = "${MACHINE_ARCH}"
BASEPKG_HOST_SYS = "${MULTIMACH_HOST_SYS}"
PACKAGE_STRIP = "no"

The 'BASEPKG_HOST_SYS' bit is what makes it work, but cause trouble is you want to read from it, so ti-paths.inc does:

export CODEGEN_INSTALL_DIR_RECIPE    = "${installdir}/ti-cgt6x"
export CODEGEN_INSTALL_DIR    = "${STAGING_DIR}/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${CODEGEN_INSTALL_DIR_RECIPE}"

Which will point it to the machine specific staging like we want it to.
