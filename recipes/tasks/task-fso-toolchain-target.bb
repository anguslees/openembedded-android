# Stuff contained in this SDK is largely taken from task-sdk-base.bb.
# This is a starting point, and nothing more at present -- please fill
# this out with a reasonable set of development tools for an FSO image.
# Also feel free to remove stuff that's silly.  And someone should
# review the glibc-gconv list to see if that makes sense.
