# Snort user
# This user will be used to launch snort. Notice that the 
# preinst script of the package might do changes to the user 
# (home directory, User Name) when the package is upgraded or
# reinstalled.  So, do *not* change this to 'root' or to any other user 
# unless you are sure there is no problem with those changes being introduced.
# 
SNORTUSER="snort"
#
# Logging directory
# Snort logs will be dropped here and this will be the home
# directory for the SNORTUSER. If you change this value you should
# change the /etc/logrotate.d/snort definition too, otherwise logs
# will not be rotated properly.

# Snort group
# This is the group that the snort user will be added to.

# Allow Snort's init.d script to work if the configured interfaces
# are not available. Set this to yes if you configure Snort with
# multiple interfaces but some might not be available on boot
# (e.g. wireless interfaces)
# 
# Note: In order for this to work the 'iproute' package needs to 
# be installed.
