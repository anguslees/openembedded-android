DESCRIPTION = "diffstat reads the output of diff and displays a histogram of \
the insertions, deletions, and modifications per-file. It is useful for \
reviewing large, complex patch files."

PRIORITY = "optional"
SECTION = "devel"

# NOTE: The upstream maintainer has a single 'diffstat.tar.gz' for the
# latest version of the package.  It could easily change out from under us.
# I'd rather rely on debian, and possible have the sources vanish, than risk
# the sources _changing_ underneith us. -CL
